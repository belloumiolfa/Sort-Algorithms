            The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding
            the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part
            and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two
            subarrays in a given array.
            <br />
            1- The subarray which is already sorted.
            <br />
            2- Remaining subarray which is unsorted. <br />
            In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element
            (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked
            and moved to the sorted subarray.

         <p>
            Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to
            the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually
            split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted
            part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted
            part.
            <br /> Algorithm <br />
            To sort an array of size n in ascending order: <br />
            1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. <br />
            2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor. <br />
            3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to
            the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to
            make space for the swapped element.

            Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It
            picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the
            picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that
            pick pivot in different ways. <br />
            1- Always pick first element as pivot.
            <br />
            2- Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below) <br />
            3- Pick a random element as pivot.
            <br />
            4- Pick median as pivot. <br />
            The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions
            is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its
            correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements
            (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater
            than x) after x.

            Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary
            Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first
            find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the
            beginning. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.
            <br />
            What is Binary Heap?
            <br /> Let us first define a Complete Binary Tree. A complete binary
            tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the
            last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as
            possible (Source Wikipedia) <br /> A Binary Heap is a Complete
            Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that the
            value in a parent node is greater(or smaller) than the values in its
            two children nodes. The former is called max heap and the latter is
            called min-heap.
